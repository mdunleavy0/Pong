Pong written for the HTML5 canvas

This repo is intended to be part of code portfolio, showcasing miscellaneous skills and achievements to potential employers. **This code is not intended for reuse.**

This code is an implementation of the game Pong for the HTML5 canvas written in vanilla Javascript.

I had been coding for less than half a year when I wrote this game (most of which was in a different language). The quality of the code probably reflects this in some places.

Still, the game is too fun to let gather dust. Plus there are some fairly tricky concepts covered here,  between the trigonometry and collision detection.
